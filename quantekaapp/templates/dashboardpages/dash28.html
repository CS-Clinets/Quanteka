                A graphic representation of essential information that highlights an organizationâ€™s performance in a range of designated areas of quality. It visualizes performance data and critical quality parameters on a single computer screen to simplify quality management analysis and reporting. Quality dashboard helps in continuous tracking and evaluation of quality management metrics, issues, trends and risks. It displays a one-page report that gives the right focus and direction for quality control and assurance actions. Such a report contains a number of smaller reports visualized through graphs, charts, tables, spreadsheets, data grids, etc. With help of quality assurance dashboard, managers can obtain an overview of progress occurring in processes and projects. They are provided with a detailed report on the quality assurance procedure, including such steps as requirements determination, certification, testing, evaluation, audit, and maintenance. Through a wide range of key performance indicators, each of the steps can be monitored and measured against quality expectations. By providing feedback on performance against different benchmarks, clinicians can gain insight on clinical performance goals, including pay-for-performance targets. Quality Dashboards take advantage of the structured data capture capability of our EHR. Quality Dashboards are intended to improve patient care and quality outcomes and to increase the perceived value of effective use of the EHR.
